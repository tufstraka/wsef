The web browser is one of the most widely used applications in today's digital era. Many individuals spend significant portions of their day interacting with web browsers for various purposes, from work to leisure activities. Inspired by this ubiquitous tool, I embarked on a personal challenge to develop my own web browser from scratch. This endeavor aimed not only to deepen my understanding of the intricacies of web browsers but also to hone my skills as a software engineer.

## Project Status

This project is a work in progress. While it's not yet a fully functional web browser, significant progress has been made in its development. Below are some key features and aspects of the current state of the project:

- Basic functionality implemented.
- User interface under construction.
- Core browsing capabilities being refined.
- Ongoing bug fixes and improvements.

## Testing

To test the current state of the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```
   git clone <repo url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Run the following command in the terminal, replacing `<link>` with the URL you want to visit:

   ```
   python urrl.py <link>
   ```

This command will launch the custom web browser and attempt to load the specified URL.

## Future Plans

While the current version of the web browser is still in its early stages, there are several exciting features and improvements planned for the future:

- Enhanced user interface for improved user experience.
- Support for additional web technologies and standards.
- Implementation of advanced browsing features such as bookmarks, tabs, and history.
- Optimization for performance and efficiency.
- Compatibility testing across different operating systems and devices.

Stay tuned for updates as the project evolves!
